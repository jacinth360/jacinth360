# Hi, I'm Jacinth 👋

## Bioinformatician | Computational Biologist

I build production-grade computational workflows for multi-omics data analysis and drug discovery. My work spans NGS pipeline development, single-cell genomics, chromatin profiling, and ML-based protein engineering—with a focus on creating scalable, reproducible analyses that drive experimental decisions.

### 🧬 What I Do

**Multi-Omics Analysis**
- RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, CUT&RUN data analysis
- Integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets
- Single-cell clustering, cell-type annotation, and differential expression

**Pipeline Development**
- Scalable workflow orchestration (Nextflow, Snakemake)
- Cloud deployment and infrastructure (AWS, Docker)
- HPC computing and batch processing (Slurm)

**Computational Drug Discovery**
- Large-scale protein sequence analysis (12M+ sequences)
- Molecular docking and structure-based design
- ML-based candidate prioritization and optimization
